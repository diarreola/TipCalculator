## Notes

I spent a majority of my time figuring out xcode 11.0 and its new features. When I first created an xcode project, I could not find the Main.storyboard file anywhere and did not know how to go about creating an app. After researching a bit, I found out that when creating an xcode project, I must set user interface to storyboard rather than SwiftUI (what I had before). Other than that, I spent most of my time debugging and getting used to Swift and the xcode environment
